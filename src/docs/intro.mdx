# Amboss Documentation

Welcome to the Amboss Documentation.
Take into account this is really early stage and still needs a lot of work!

Friendly reminder: DON'T BE RECKLESS.

## About Amboss

Amboss is a professional node manager for lightning. Amboss can manage multiple nodes and display advanced visualizations to provide the user with the information to make good decisions with their lightning node.

The visualizers and widgets are built to be a fully customizable platform to display the information that is directly relevant to the users' goals with their lightning node.

Amboss can be installed on a physical node (such as a [Raspiblitz](/docs/raspiblitz)) or can be installed on a virtual private server (VPS) like [DigitalOcean](/docs/cloud).


Amboss is a open-source project licensed under GPLv3.0. Contributions and modifications are welcomed.
