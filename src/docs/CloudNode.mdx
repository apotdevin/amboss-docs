# Setting up a Cloud server
For easier access to the Amboss tools, some users may find it convenient to deploy Amboss on a cloud service. 
Since cloud services may be more easily accessed, be sure to enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to increase the security of your funds and your data.
These instructions are only intended to be a helpful resource, not an endorsement of these cloud server products.

## DigitalOcean Hosting
DigitalOcean hosting has a set of tools that can be used to host Amboss. 
From the default projects, navigate to the "Create something new" section and select "Create a Droplet" to create a cloud server.

Using the Marketplace tab, select a Docker image deployment on Ubuntu.

The $10/month plan provides sufficient resources to make full use of the Amboss toolset.

Next, scroll down to the Authentication section (all other sections can be left as default)
Choose a secure password (use a password manager!) to create a root password.
The password requirements are as follows:
    * At least 8 characters long
    * Must contain 1 uppercase (first and last characters donâ€™t count)
    * Must contain 1 number
    * Cannot end in a number or special character

With the authentication complete, scroll down and select "Create Droplet."

The created droplet will take a moment to start and will then supply an IP address to access the server.

Copy the IP address and use SSH to access the server. This example will use PuTTY for the SSH functions.

Following a standard security prompt (choose yes), login as `root` and use the root password from the DigitalOcean Authentication.

# Cloud Installation

To install Amboss on the cloud server, switch to the root user.

`sudo su - `

Create a folder for Amboss

`mkdir amboss`

Change Directories into the new folder.

`cd amboss`

Copy the code from the Amboss repository on GitHub.

`git clone https://github.com/AmbossTech/amboss-docker`

Change directories again into the amboss-docker folder.

`cd amboss-docker`

![Cloud Download](/assets/docs/raspiblitz/DO-PuTTY-git.png)

Set the environment variables to point the cloud server to a domain that you own.

`export AMBOSS_HOST="YOUROWNDOMAIN.com"`

Lastly, enter the installation command and refresh your webpage. This may take a couple minutes.

`. ./amboss-setup.sh -i `
