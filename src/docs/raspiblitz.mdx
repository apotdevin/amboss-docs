# Raspiblitz Installation

To install Amboss on your raspiblitz node, first access the command line of your node

![Raspiblitz Menu](/assets/docs/raspiblitz/menu.png)

From the command line, switch to the root user:

```bash
sudo su -
```

Create a directory for Amboss and go into the folder:

```bash
mkdir amboss
cd amboss
```

Clone the amboss code from github and go into the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmbossTech/amboss-docker
cd amboss-docker
```

Set environment variables. Replace amboss.local with your node’s server address, which can simply be your node's local IP.

```bash
export AMBOSS_HOST="amboss.local"
export REVERSEPROXY_DEFAULT_HOST="$AMBOSS_HOST"
export AMBOSSGEN_REVERSEPROXY=none
```

Run the Setup script. (This will take several minutes)

```bash
. ./amboss-setup.sh -i
```

In a web browser, navigate to your node’s local IP with port 3021 by default:

```bash
<Node Local IP>:3021
```

Congrats! You’ve now installed Amboss!
