# Initial Amboss Setup
Now that Amboss is installed, here are the steps to get started managing the connected nodes. Amboss uses email notifications for events, which is completely customizable.
 
First, enter an email address that you’d like to use for notifications. Choose a secure password that will safeguard your funds such as one generated from a password manager e.g. Bitwarden, KeePass.
 
## Add Your First Node
Amboss is built to operate with several nodes. To add your first node, enter the details needed to communicate with it:
In the Socket field, use the following format for a node running on Tor:
https://<node pubkey>@<tor address from Mobile Zeus Android connect>:8080
 
### Add a Raspiblitz Node
To get the Tor address from a raspiblitz node with REST Endpoints, navigate to the Mobile option in the raspiblitz menu.

Select the Zeus Android option.
 
There’s no need to install Zeus for this setup, so select Continue.
 
An IP2Tor Bridge is not needed. Proceed with “No Thanks”.
 
Select Tor as the connect option instead of the fallback for privacy.
 
All that’s needed is the Tor address, which can be gathered from the Console QRcode option.

 
Select and copy the .onion address from one of the areas redacted in red.
