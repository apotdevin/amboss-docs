# Initial Amboss Setup

Now that Amboss is installed, here are the steps to get started managing the connected nodes. Amboss uses email notifications for events, which is completely customizable.

First, enter an email address that you’d like to use for notifications. Choose a secure password that will safeguard your funds such as one generated from a password manager e.g. Bitwarden, KeePass.

## Add Your First Node

Amboss is built to operate with several nodes. To add your first node, enter the details needed to communicate with it:
In the Socket field, use the following format for a node running on Tor:
`https://<node pubkey>@<tor address from Mobile Zeus Android connect>:8080`

### Add a Raspiblitz Node

To get the Tor address from a raspiblitz node with REST Endpoints, navigate to the Mobile option in the raspiblitz menu.

Select the Zeus Android option.

There’s no need to install Zeus for this setup, so select Continue.

An IP2Tor Bridge is not needed. Proceed with “No Thanks”.

Select Tor as the connect option instead of the fallback for privacy.

All that’s needed is the Tor address, which can be gathered from the Console QRcode option.

Select and copy the .onion address from one of the areas redacted in red.

Construct the Socket entry using the .onion address with port 8080 to provide Amboss with the REST endpoints that it uses. Omit the spaces.

`https:// <node pubkey> @ <.onion address> :8080 `

Example: `https://03902356d26efdc0812726c31a1a2e0d721f26063dd252ac89ded8280037e9ece8@x26jn5xnh3rhxlrd7flvlidbhu4a5lqiaukd7l72kp5pgrfozr45ufad.onion:8080`

## Fetch the Hex Macaroon

The next entry to finish the Amboss setup in to give Amboss the Macaroon to manage your node. The macaroon is a set of authorization credentials that will allow Amboss to view and manage the channels on your node.

### Raspiblitz Macaroon

From the raspiblitz main menu, navigate to the LNDCREDS section.

![Raspiblitz Menu LND Creds](/assets/docs/raspiblitz/ras-menu-LNDcreds.png)

Choose EXPORT to get the Macaroons and the TLS.cert.

![Raspiblitz Export LND Creds](/assets/docs/raspiblitz/ras-LNDcreds-export.png)

Export the information using a Hex String.

![Raspiblitz Export Hex](/assets/docs/raspiblitz/ras-LNDcreds-hex.png)

Copy the admin.macaroon or the readonly.macaroon into the Macaroon field of Amboss, depending on the permissions you would like to grant to your Amboss installation.

Congratulations, you've added your first node!

For next steps, consider adding two factor authentication for increased security.
