# Manual Install

Installing and running Amboss without Docker has some more steps but can also be done.

1. You need to run a Redis and Postgres instance locally.
2. Install and run [Amboss-Nest](https://github.com/AmbossTech/amboss-nest)
3. Install and run [Amboss-Web](https://github.com/AmbossTech/amboss-web)
